The goal of the practice is to create an airport portal with basic functionality to add\remove flights, change their statuses and display.
1. Database design, T-SQL (stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc)
2. MS SQL Project - import database created manually to new project and continue development there.
3. ASP.NET MVC + ADO.NET (+ jQueryUI or similar). Create admin page for the portal. SCRUM introduction at some point.
4. ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET web API + Entity Framework (+ jQueryUI, knockout JS or similar) Front-end page (probably single page)
5. Continious integration (Teamcity or Octopus, MS Web Deploy ). Deploy everything we created somewhere (remote Web server, Azure)


Functionality:
1.add/remove (manage) update flight
2. company 4 each flight
3. schedule - from/to - filter view


0. Import created database into VS SQL Project, make changes so that each table with primary key will have clustered index.
1. Add Stored Procedure to generate schedule for specified date input. 
Optional parameter - flightId (specifying which will generate schedule only for that flight)
2. Function to calculate the number of planes landing at the specified time.
3. Our airport is small, that's why it is possible to arrive only 4 planes at a time.
If some scheduled landing intersects with some other landing try to find other time to land iterating landing time with 5 minutes periods untill free landing pass awailable.
Use trigger.
4. Console application which calls Stored procedure to generate schedule. Use ADO.NET to connect to database.


- Commit and push changes after each task completed.

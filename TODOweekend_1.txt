6. Composed a plan for SQL
MS SQL. Things to understand
Database design:
1. Data types
2. Table relations
3. Indexes
4. Database normal forms

T-SQL:
1. Views
2. Triggers
3. Stored Procedures
4. Functions (what are the differences between Function and Stored Procedures, when we should use one or another)
5. Transactions
6. Transaction isolation levels

Should know how to:
- Use SQL Server Management Studio.
    Just basic things like:
    * Connect to database
    * Make a query
    * Validate query
    * Execute query
    * Debug
    * View execution plan
- Use SQL Server Profiler
Hope we will try to use all of these during the practice
